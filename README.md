This repository collects two pieces of work I wanted to share publicly:
a complete agentic RAG system built for healthcare Q&A, and the acceptance documents from my IHCI’17 publication (Springer LNCS).

1. Agentic RAG for Healthcare QnA

This folder contains a working RAG pipeline designed for medical question answering.
It includes a curated dataset, a retrieval index, and a small set of services (gateway, backend, and UI) that run together through Docker.

The goal was to build something simple, fast, and easy to understand:

a clean retrieval flow (FAISS)

a lightweight generation module

a clear separation between services

reproducible local setup

All code and documentation for this project is inside:

`agentic_RAG_forHealthcareQnA/`

2. IHCI’17 – Springer LNCS (Acceptance Documents)

This PDF contains my paper acceptance email and presentation certificate from IHCI 2017 (Springer LNCS series).

I am not allowed to upload the final published paper due to Springer’s copyright agreement, so the acceptance documents are provided instead:

`IHCI17_SPRINGER_LNCS.pdf`
